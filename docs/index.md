# Ze is C, the missing C runtime

## Background

This library was initially a rework/refactor and merge of [libco](https://github.com/higan-emu/libco) with [minicoro](https://github.com/edubart/minicoro). These two differ among many [coru](https://github.com/geky/coru), [libdill](https://github.com/sustrik/libdill), [libmill](https://github.com/sustrik/libmill), [libwire](https://github.com/baruch/libwire), [libcoro](https://github.com/semistrict/libcoro), [libcsp](https://github.com/shiyanhui/libcsp), [dyco-coroutine](https://github.com/piaodazhu/dyco-coroutine), in that Windows is supported, and not using **ucontext**. That was until I came across [libtask](https://swtch.com/libtask), where the design is the underpinning of GoLang, and made it Windows compatible in an fork [symplely/libtask](https://github.com/symplely/libtask). **Libtask** has it's channel design origins from [Richard Beton's libcsp](https://libcsp.sourceforge.net/)

You can read [Fibers, Oh My!](https://graphitemaster.github.io/fibers/) for a breakdown on how the actual context switch here is achieved by assembly. This library incorporates [libuv](http://docs.libuv.org) in a way that make providing callbacks unnecessary, same as in [Using C++ Resumable Functions with Libuv](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/using-ibuv-with-c-resumable-functions/). **Libuv** is handling any hardware or multi-threading CPU access. This not necessary for library usage, the setup can be replaced with some other Event Loop library, or just disabled. There is a unmaintained [libasync](https://github.com/btrask/libasync) package tried combining **libco**, with **libuv** too, Linux only.
